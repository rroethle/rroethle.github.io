		<h5>Week 1 Day 1</h5>
		<p>Today was the first day of our code camp. We started off with general introductions. Our first lab focused on a python script using tweep from the twitter api. we discussed importing specific items from different python files. We created a new gmail account, a new google phone number, and a new twitter account,we were able to review some python script and modify it so it would send out tweets to our newly generated twitter page. Then we reviewed a second file so that it would take our file and tweet out random lines from our file. I learned not to use tab and to use spaces instead (I normally used tabs). I also learned how to stop the command line from running by using control-c.We then met to discuss source code control programs and that git would be our main program to use. We breifly touched on it and then were assigned a lab. I am struggling with using git and this lab. I have gotten the hang of initializing a repository(git init), changing a file, adding the file to be changed (git add),and then commiting a file (git commit). I have to figure out how to do it remotely yet and how to use Source Tree as that was a disaster also. Git is going to take some getting use to but I know it's a big deal. </p>

		<h5>Week 1 Day 3</h5>
		<p>Today was mainly focused on building our dice game which I thought was awesome given how complex we made the rules.<br> We did two lectures focused on loops (for and while) and string manipulation. Seeing as how I had researched for in loops and while loops to work in my dice game this was a good review but I did learn a few different commands. The break and continue commands will be helpful. Continue will end a current iteration and jump back to the start of the while loop and run again. A break will end the while loop that you are currently in.<br> When dealing with string manipulation, I learned about using str.find() which find the first occurrence of an item. strings.lstrip, .strip, .rstrip remove whitespace from a string (strip will remove it from both sides) None of them remove whitespace from the middle of the string inside of the quotes. I didn't know about the  .startswith and .endswith functions. The .replace function will replace all occurrences of a string which I thought was interesting. I also learned that these functions do not modify the item we are running it on, but create a new string for each which we can store in another variable.<br> In my dice game, I've learned mainly about loops, string formatting, and how to return information in functions. String formatting command is simply {}.format(my variables I want to replace).  Here is an example: {0:15}{1:^15}{2:^15}.format(player[0],player[3],player[4]) I tried calling the same function within itself but it doesn't seem like it will work, but I'll keep trying. <br> I've also learned I can get lost in my own code so I need to make smaller chunks of code and document it better and name my variables better because there were a couple of times I really had to think as to what I was doing.<br> Debugging is also a pain trying to go through the game many, many times and figure out it it actually works for all situations. Printing out each and every step helps alot.<br> Today was a satisfying day for me because I felt like I broke through and mainly completed my game. There was a  point where I wanted to just say good enough and stop, but I took a break and re-focused and broke through that barrier.<br> I'm excited to see my finished product tomorrow.</p>

		<h5>Week 1 Day 4</h5>
		<p>Morning - Finished up the lab from last night and re-did the modular arithmetic problem.<br> The problem asked to output YUP if an inputed number divided by 10 was within 2 of a number that ended in 0. Because of how floating points work,  when decimal numbers were added, I was getting incorrect results. By importing the Decimal module and creating decimal types for my numbers, I was able to make the precision less and the program worked.<br> We learned about functions with our normal lecture and were then asked to create a function to calculate our pay for a given week based on user inputed hours and pay rate. The function asks us to use overtime hours in our calculation. I was able to use successfully for the first time the try except and have it run repeatedly by re-asking for the user values and return the raw_input function on the except. I was also able to format the function to two decimal places by using the {0:.2f}.format(total_pay) (total pay was my variable which stored my total_pay). The 0 is the placeholder spot for total_pay and the .2f tells .format to go to 2 decimal places and make it a float.<br> I was able to work my own project for a bit concerning my data science goal by making a python program that will output the number of degrees of freedom from a directed graph. Hopefully, I'll get to work on this some more as the class proceeds.<br> The afternoon was spent working on a dice game we created as a group and then individually, we were sent to make a program for it. so far my biggest lessons is using a for in loop over a list. Storing each players information as a list has been helpful. Also, I created a DICE list storing each die we use and giving that to each player. This was a mistake because when I updated each player's dice list, it updated all of the players so I had to make sure each player had their own individual list. We did not make this game easy on our selves because we have to keep track of scores assigned to the dice during the game. This is challenging.<br> Finally, when committing to git hub I need to remember that if I create a READ ME file from adding a repository on git hub, I need to first pull the repository or clone it to my local spot and then push it. Also when adding the remote repository I need to make sure to use the command git remote add origin  url where url is the location of my git hub remote repository.<br> I have a feeling I will be working on this program a bit tonight so my night isn't over yet!<br> </p>

		<h5>Week 1 Day 5</h5>
		<p>Today was focused more on reinforcement and reflection. We had more time to finish our dice game and I was ableto finish up debugging for my computer player.<br>  One major tool I learned today was concerning list comprehensions. I was happy to learn about the enumerate function which creates a list mapping our values to different indexes which when used with list comprehensions make it easy for me to get multiple max or min values from my lists. List comprehensions allowed me to create lists in single lines of code rather than multiple blocks.<br> We had a lecture on Google searching and this was helpful to know what a more efficient way to was to search in Google. It was interesting to know that the simpler we keep our search terms the better results we will get.<br> We reviewed our labs today to verify they were correct. Andrew reminded me about the split command. I can use this to break apart an email address and then verify it's in the correct format. Also I could have validated the first letter for a character rather than making sure it wasn't a digit, but either way worked fine.<br> We did a whiteboard challenge called fizz buzz. I forgot to use modular division at first instead of integer division but Andrew let me work through it and I finished the problem.<br> Main point driven home today is simpler, more modular codes put inside smaller functions to help me develop smarter and easier to debug code.<br> I finished Lab 4 on Loops with nothing too new to go over as most of what we have done were involved in our Dice Game.</p>

		<h5>Week 2 Day 6</h5>
		<p>The second week began with Nick instructing us how to post our reflections blog to our github.io pages. Very interesting to know how to do this. It was great practice to use git again to set up repositories and push and pull. I was able to look at the code they provided and even though it was JavaScript and HTML I felt like I could at least understand what it was saying (not the commands) which is encouraging. We entered in our entries as JSON objects and it was here that I learned to be very mindful of sytax and punctuation like double quotes or single quotes that could become problamatic. After all was done, we got our blog posts up and we set off to work on some labs. I am currently working on a problem to spell out all numbers from 1 to a minimum of 1 million.<br> We then had a very interesting lecture on OOP or object oriented programming. Very awesome. Using classes and child classes to arange as many instances I need of an object would have come in very handy for our dice game. The key terms I would like to learn more about are encapsulation and polymorphism because they didn't qutie stick in my brain at first when he intruduced them. Using the keyword self made sense and init (instantiate) the object also finally clicked for the first time as I had heard them discussed before but couldn't ever put it into practice.<br> A few other quick notes on the lecture were methods and attributes (attributes describe the object) and methods take action or do something to the object. Finally getters and setters where getters return values from an object and setters set values from the object.<br> We were then given a task to create an item from our back pack or from the room and turn it into an object and make methods and attributes on it. Unfortunately I choose granola bar and given what we learned next, this wasn't the best choice. What we did learn next is that we would be creating a game based on the objects we created. As a team we had to come up with the rules and game play and then as a group develop the game. As you can see oatmeal was a bad choice.<br> We created the rules on one board and then pseudo-coded our class file on another. When we finished, it was quite hard for us to determine who should do what and how to proceed next seeing as how most of us had never worked in a collaborative environment before in the programming world. We decided to each try and develop some of the initial class code and then we would review it and discuss. As we broke off, we had to set up a repository again on Roberts computer which would be considered our master and then we would fork his repository over and work from that. This was a bit difficult doing for the first time but Nick helped us through the command line prompts and we got some more practice.<br> The rest of the day consisted of us tinkering with the player class code for our game. Upon reflecting (and what we should pobably do for tomorrow), we need to accurately decide inputs and outputs for certain functions and then assign them to people so that no matter how they solve the problem it won't matter. Also breaking our code into seperate files will help with revision control. There are alot of leasons to learn from this that I'll report more on tomorrow as we go through this collaborative experience.</p>

		<h5>Week 2 Day 7</h5>
		<p>Today was split into three parts for me. We started out working on the game.<br>I completed my initial portion which finally allowed the rest to get started. Working in a collaborative environment was difficult but I feel like a great learning experience. It's tough because we are still learning, but I think we need to learn how to work in a group and think in terms of black boxes and inputs and outputs instead of processes initially.<br> We had a fun lecture on bits and network speed that I really did enjoy. (I wasn't being sarcastic). I think it's great to get a more basic knowledge of how computers function.<br> We then got back at the game and I was able to complete the timer function for our inputs. I learned about threading briefly and I think I want to touch that on another time, but I found a great stack overflow article that explained counters and how the loop would constantly check the time and after 15 seconds the loop would stop after using the msvcrt module<br> We had a great presentation from WennSoft where their hr manager told us what she looks for and their interview process. This was VERY valuable because I really was curious to hear the other side of things. Knowing references are becoming less used now a days was good news given my career change. Also getting another perspective on how long interview processes take was beneficial to hear. Finally, I wasn't aware they did a technical test that early in the process so now I know to ask about this ahead of time.<br> We finished up the day by working on our game and after our scrum meeting we learned that we were struggling because we never assigned a project manager. This definitely confirmed some of the struggles we were having. I think we are close though as the main game logic is coming together. It's neat to see a project come together however, I still don't understand all of the pieces of the puzzle yet. We will have it finished by tomorrow. Looking forward to getting some rest tonight that is for sure. </p>

		<h5>Week 2 Day 8</h5>
		<p>Today was focused into two sections. The first dealt with us finishing our game between objects. Our main goal was to debug our program and add in some functionality involving my playerClass. I have learned working in collaboration really involves communication and teamwork in a computer science discipline. For example, I had what I thought were changes done to my file but because I was interacting with other files, changes my teammates made required me to make additional changes. Git(revision control) and teamwork were EXTREMELY important.<br><br> For the first section of the afternoon I focused on completing a lab question. I wrote a small program that would tell you if it was dark outside based on the time of day and time of year (basically it took the month and compared it against approximate sunrise and sunset times.)<br> The rest of the day has been spent on getting started on our first personal project. Mine is a simple program that will take stock option data for a symbol and allow me to record how the price moves throughout the day. I want to include an interface with it but my goal is to get it to work with one stock and then apply it to a range of stocks from there. I've been frustrated at the moment because I can't seem to find any good libraries or modules to accomplish this.<br> My main struggle has been trying to install the pandas and matlab module so I can actually do something with this.</p>

		<h5>Week 2 Day 9</h5>
		<p>I finished my personal project today for my options web scraper project and I am pretty excited about this. I was looking at creating a program to gather all of the options expiration data for particular stocks minute by minute. I created a console program that does this and I am working on building a GUI interface so users can easily do this as well.<br> I learned some pretty valuable lessons from this. The first was to lay out your plan first and then focus on designing the minimum functional product first and then add functionality to it once you accomplished the task. Very important lesson to learn in making sure you meet a project deadline. Secondly, I was taught a valuable lesson about modules. There are a million modules in python and they are not created equal. Some are very difficult to install and when making a project that needs to be completed by a deadline, if a certain module is not meeting your needs. Switch your scope and try another one.<br>Learning how to scrape the web was pretty fun and interesting to me. I was able to pull data from a website using beautifulsoup and requests and it is a powerful tool to use especially for machine learning and data analysis from the web that I plan on using in the future. Outputing the data received to json or csv files after is also valuable. The better and cleaner the data is on output the easier it will be to use after. Finally, I used a module from python that allowed me to create a user interface. While I thought it saved me time, I am still not sure I made the right choice here because once I had to do some customizing, I had to learn how to use the original module used in designing it so I am not sure I saved any time. Just something else for me to think about.<br>Today felt good to accomplish my project and finish my labs so I am looking forward to finishing up the week on a high note tommorrow and put week 2 in the books!</p>

		<h5>Week 2 Day 10</h5>
		<p>After another night debugging my personal project I finally think I have my first iteration done!  In an example of how far I think I have come in two weeks, I had never known we could open up more than one command line prompt windows to run multiple files at the same time. Knowing little things like that are second nature to some, but for me learning that little trick was so cool!  Just goes to show me that I have so much to learn. Anyway, my project collects options expiration data and spits it out into a csv file that I import directly into excel. I have set up a list of items for me to improve on and the first of which is going to be to import the matplotlib, numpy, and pandas module so I can do my analysis directly! Speaking of those modules, I had my biggest breakthrough today regarding installing them! When I first began my project I had a the hardest time using installing these modules because they are supported by other modules and those also need to be installed first and they have to be installed in the right user directory. I spent some time really digging into how these modules should be installed correctly. For one, the easiest path I should have done was install an encompassing program like Anaconda that installs all of these for me directly. I have to be careful here because this may set up multiple python installations for me so I have to watch where I install this(I learned this the hard way). Secondly, if using pip install or pip install upgrade does not work, I can directly install something called the binary file(the module by itself) by either its wheel file or tar file, and then install it by using them. (I love that I can use some of these technical terms now). Well, enough about modules for now, but needless to say I had some big breakthrough in installing them! One final note from my morning session. I did a tutorial on a graphical user interface called Kivy for python to hopefully help get a better GUI interface for my program. I am going to keep playing with this because TKinter does not give the look I am going for. Plus, since event driven programming using GUIs is different in programming than providing console programs, I am going to keep on looking to improve my skills for this type of programming.<br></p>

		<h5>Week 3 Day 11</h5>
		<p>Game Day. We learned we are building a classic arcade game similar to Asteroids. We are being led by one of 1st groups members and Brandon had a great kick-off meeting. Our first assignment was learning about the module called Pygames in python. I had initial trouble installing the binary file but with my previous experiencing installing modules for my personal project, we were all able to get it installed. One very important lesson I have also learned is all tutorials are not created equal. I had trouble initial learning about how to use the various methods in pygame so I purchased a kindle book to help me out and it was very helpful. The book was Building Arcade games for Python using Pygames and it explained how to use sprites and help with collision detection. The rest of our day was filled with dividing up our task and figuring out how to collaborate. This was an achilles heal for us the first time so it will be nice for us to give this a second shot. My task is to build our ship class so I get to use some of my math knowledge to build how the ship will fly. My goal is to have this completed by the end of the night!</p>

		<h5>Week 3 Day 12</h5>
		<p>Game Day part 2. After a long previous night of finishing reading Pygame for Arcade Games, I finally think I have a handle on collision control with sprites (or at least I thought I did). After getting my ship class to fly, I thought it would be a piece of cake to have my ship collide with some asteroids. Boy was I mistaken. After hours of trial and error, I discovered that pygame uses the sprite image and determines and x and y coordinate separately called rect-x and rect-y which it uses for collision detection. Wow...I relooked at my notes and sure enough it was starring me in the face. Sometimes I just need to do a better job of framing my problem before powering through an issue.<br> We also learned about AGILE and how it corresponds to a workflow environment. This was very interesting to me because of how similar I found this to the LEAN work environment. In the design engineering world we do things similar but it was awesome to see how our workflow would be! Our afternoon was filled with getting our daily build complete and merging our files together to hopefully have a working build. I think we have completed this and feel good about leaving for the night.</p>

		<h5>Week 3 Day 13</h5>
		<p>Game Day part 3. DANG! We began the day in a much worse spot than were we left it. When we left last night, it seemed like our files collaborated nicely but it turned out we were all tinerking a bit in each others files and not merging our repositories together. Turns out our merging did not go smoothly and none of our files work correctly. This led to us having our daily meeting and much frustration (not at each other but with a lack of understanding how to work in a group) After talking it over we developed a new strategy with more communication and with us creating a new clone of our repository and with us only pushing our files we worked on and us pulling all of the files first before we commit and merge to verify our files work. By using source tree we are then able to see when pulls and updates have occurred. A huge breakthrough for us and a major learning milestone reached for learning to work collaboratively. We fixed our files and were able to get back to where we were last night with our ship flying around on the screen with asteroids. We then worked on getting our asteroid class working, a bullet class, and finalizing our graphics. We ditched using the built in sprite collision for now as our own method of calculating the location seemed to work better and at the end of the day we got the bullets to remove the asteroids!  What a great feeling that was! We also learned that having excessive print statement can really slow down a game utilizing graphics. It was a great end to the day after I began it feeling so lost. </p>
